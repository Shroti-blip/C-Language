## ⚙️ Tools & Setup

* **Compiler**: `gcc` (MinGW on Windows, or use VS Code with Code Runner extension)
* **IDE**: VS Code / Code::Blocks / Turbo C (if in academic environment)
* **OS**: Windows/Linux

## ✅ How to Run

```bash
# compile
gcc filename.c -o output

# run
./output
```

Or use the **Code Runner extension in VS Code** to run the program directly.
